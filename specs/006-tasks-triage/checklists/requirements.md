## Notes

- A11Y Governance applied: affected artefacts are process mode, home task preview, task view, new-task dialog, and completion/restore feedback. WCAG 2.2 AA evidence is required under `docs/accessibility/`; bilingual delivery is N/A because this feature adds no non-English user-facing surface.
